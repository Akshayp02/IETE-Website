Sure, here are the steps in Markdown format to fork a React application from a GitHub repository and run it on your localhost:

1. *Fork the Repository:*
   - Go to the main repository's URL: [https://github.com/DIEMS-HUB/IETE-Website](https://github.com/DIEMS-HUB/IETE-Website)
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page to create your own copy of the repository.

2. *Clone the Forked Repository:*
   - On your GitHub profile, find the forked repository (`YourUsername/IETE-Website`).
   - Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
   - Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/IETE-Website.git`.

3. *Install Dependencies:*
   - Navigate into the project folder using `cd IETE-Website`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

4. *Run the Development Server:*
   - After the dependencies are installed, run `npm start`.
   - This will start the development server, and the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

5. *Make Changes (Optional):*
   - Open the project in your favorite code editor.
   - Make any desired changes or customizations to the code.

6. *Commit and Push Changes:*
   - After making changes, use `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Then, commit the changes with `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`.
   - Finally, push the changes to your forked repository using `git push origin main`.

7. *Create a Pull Request (Optional):*
   - If you've made changes that you'd like to contribute back to the original repository, you can create a pull request from your fork.
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Pull Request" button.
   - Follow the prompts to create a pull request, which will allow the original repository's maintainers to review and potentially merge your changes.

Remember to replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username. Good luck with your React application development!
